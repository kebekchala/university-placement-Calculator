passwords are encrypted in the program, here are the real passwords for each user name;
[user name]           [password]
roskee1                unknown
nahooo                 hahaha
kebek                  what?
kidi                   kidistc
meseret                mesibaba
nati                   natiman
password encryption method:
	-alphabets are assigned 1-26 from a-z
	-any other symbols are assigned the value of their ASCII code minus 96
	-numbers are given the value of their original value minus 96
	-these corresponding values for each character in the password are added
	-the sum is then devided (the devision is integer division. reminder being left behind)
         by the number of characters of the password
	-the value above is then added to the number of characters and then is squared
	-then the square of the value of the first character of the password is substracted from the value above
	-the value from the above processes is the key code for the password.

then every time the user types a password, the computer takes the password and applys the formula above. if the result
is the same with the key code for that password, access is granted. there is a vary rare chance that different passwords
may have the same keycode but this is a better choice than writing the real passwords in the code.
